Okay, my apologies for the previous incorrect assessment. Saving is a core function, and if it's broken, that needs to be the absolute top priority. I've updated the prompt to reflect this critical bug.

**Continuation Prompt for CodeCraft IDE Development**

**Project:** CodeCraft IDE - A desktop IDE using Electron, React, TypeScript.

**Current Status:**
The development environment uses a manual Vite configuration with a multi-terminal workflow (`dev:main`, `dev:vite`, `start`). The core architecture is functional, but **critical bugs exist**:

*   **Main Process (`src/main/index.ts`):** Handles window creation (starts fullscreen), standard application menu, IPC handling (Ping, Dialogs), manages multiple `node-pty` instances mapped by unique IDs, and handles filesystem operations (read dir/file, save file) via IPC. Hardware acceleration is disabled.
*   **Preload Script (`src/preload/index.ts`):** Exposes a type-safe `electronAPI` via `contextBridge` for all required IPC communication, including multi-terminal management, filesystem access, dialogs, and basic app/window controls.
*   **Renderer Process (`src/renderer`):** Uses React, TypeScript, and Vite.
    *   **Layout:** Uses `Allotment` for resizable horizontal (Sidebar/MainPanel) and vertical (Editor/Terminal Area) splits.
    *   **Theming:** Uses `ThemeContext` for managing theme name and font size modifier. Theme classes (`.theme-*`) applied dynamically. `CustomSelect` used for theme switching.
    *   **Contexts:** `ThemeContext`, `EditorContext`, `TerminalContext` are implemented.
    *   **Sidebar:** Features a working file tree (`FileTreeNode`) populated via IPC (`fs:readDirectory`), supporting directory expansion. Open folder functionality populates the tree root. Clicking files opens them in the editor via `EditorContext` / `fs:readFile`. Up-directory navigation works. Contains theme switcher.
    *   **Editor Area:**
        *   Managed by `EditorContext`, supports multiple file tabs (`TabContainer`, `Tab`).
        *   Handles opening, closing, focusing tabs, tracking dirty state (visible on tab).
        *   **BUG:** File saving (`fs:saveFile` IPC / Ctrl+S) is **NOT working correctly**. Reports indicate it fails to save changes.
        *   Renders a functional Monaco Editor instance (`EditorPanel`).
        *   Basic language detection based on file extension is active.
        *   *Syntax highlighting customization deferred.*
    *   **Terminal Area:**
        *   Managed by `TerminalContext`, supports multiple terminal tabs (`TerminalTabContainer`, `TerminalTab`) with a '+' button.
        *   Renders functional Xterm.js instances (`TerminalPanel`) for each tab using CSS visibility/layering.
        *   Backend PTY communication via IPC is functional and multi-instance aware.
        *   Terminal theme colors update based on the selected app theme.
        *   **Fixed:** Rendering glitches (blank screen, background color bleed, cursor offset) when switching tabs.
        *   **Fixed:** Width issues for full-screen terminal applications (e.g., `lynx`).

**Key Recent Achievements:**
*   Successfully implemented multi-terminal tabs.
*   Resolved terminal rendering and width issues upon tab switching.

**V1 Goals Recap (Updated Status):**
*   Functional Monaco Editor (Partially Done - multi-file tabs, basic highlighting. **Saving broken.**)
*   Integrated Terminal (xterm+node-pty) (Done - multi-terminal tabs, rendering/width fixed)
*   File Tree/Management (Partially Done - open folder, read dir/file, display tree. **Saving broken.**)
*   Theming (Foundation done. *Advanced features deferred.*)
*   Font Size Control (Done)
*   Movable/Resizable Panels (Done)

**Next Steps to Implement:**

1.  **(CRITICAL) Fix File Saving:**
    *   Diagnose why the `activeFileNow.isDirty` check in `EditorPanel.tsx`'s Ctrl+S handler might be failing or why the `saveActiveFile` function in `EditorContext.tsx` isn't successfully triggering the `fs:saveFile` IPC call or processing its response correctly.
    *   Use console logs extensively in `handleInternalChange` (EditorPanel), `updateActiveFileDirtyState` (EditorContext), the Ctrl+S handler (EditorPanel), and `saveActiveFile` (EditorContext) to trace the `isDirty` state and the save attempt flow.
    *   Verify the `fs:saveFile` IPC handler in `main/index.ts` is receiving the correct path and content and not encountering filesystem errors (permissions, etc.).
    *   Ensure the `content` state in `EditorContext` is correctly updated *after* a successful save to reset the dirty state.

2.  **(HIGH) Editor Polish (After Save Fixed):**
    *   Implement a **Status Bar** component.
    *   Wire up relevant **Edit Menu** items.
    *   Consider "Save As..." functionality.

3.  **(HIGH) Terminal Polish:**
    *   Add a "Clear Terminal" button/command.
    *   Improve visual indication when a terminal process has exited.

4.  **(MED) Theming - Syntax Highlighting Customization:**
    *   Revisit `EditorPanel.tsx` and add/refine `rules` in `defineTheme`.

5.  **(MED) Main Menu Integration & Accelerators:**
    *   Review menu items and ensure they trigger correct actions.
    *   Verify standard keyboard accelerators.

6.  **(MED) Error Handling:**
    *   Improve user feedback for errors (file ops, PTY).

7.  **(LOW) Theming - VS Code Import:**
    *   Implement IPC and parsing logic for `.json` themes.

8.  **(LOW) File Management Extras:**
    *   New File, New Folder, Delete, Rename.

9.  **(LOW) Font Loading:**
    *   Implement robust loading/fallback for custom fonts.

**Question:** The **absolute priority** is fixing the file saving functionality (Step 1).

---

**Future Ideas / "Cool Stuff" Brainstorm:**

*   **Search:** Implement project-wide text search (potentially using `ripgrep` via IPC). Find/Replace within the current editor file (using Monaco's built-in actions).
*   **Git Integration:** Display Git status in the file tree/status bar, provide basic Git commands (commit, push, pull) via UI elements and IPC calls to the `git` CLI.
*   **Command Palette:** Add a VS Code-style command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) for quick access to commands (Open File, Change Theme, Git commands, etc.).
*   **Snippets:** Support for user-defined code snippets.
*   **Debugger Integration:** Integrate a debugger for a specific language (e.g., Node.js) using the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) - complex.
*   **Extensibility/Plugin System:** Design a basic plugin system to allow adding custom functionality or themes (very advanced).
*   **Settings UI:** Create a dedicated UI panel for managing settings (theme, font size, editor options, terminal options) instead of just the theme dropdown. Persist settings using `electron-store` or similar.
*   **Remote Development/SSH:** Allow opening folders and running terminals over SSH connections.
*   **Web Version:** Explore using the same codebase (with adjustments for Node APIs) to build a web-based version using something like `vscode-web`.
*   **AI Code Assistance:** Integrate with AI APIs (like CodeLlama, GitHub Copilot APIs, etc.) for code suggestions and completion (requires API keys, careful implementation).
*   **Markdown Preview:** Add a live preview panel for Markdown files.
*   **Improved Layout Options:** Use libraries like `react-mosaic` for more complex draggable/dockable panel layouts.

**Continuation Prompt for CodeCraft IDE Development**

**Project:** CodeCraft IDE - A desktop IDE using Electron, React, TypeScript.

**Current Status:**
We have successfully set up the development environment using a manual Vite configuration with a multi-terminal workflow:
1.  Terminal 1: `npm run dev:main` (Compiles `src/main` and `src/preload` via `tsc --watch`)
2.  Terminal 2: `npm run dev:vite` (Runs Vite dev server via `vite`)
3.  Terminal 3: `npm start` (Launches the Electron app via `electron .`)

The application structure includes:
*   **Main Process (`src/main/index.ts`):** Handles window creation, IPC (Ping, PTY management, Dialog), application menu creation (File, Edit, View with Theme submenu), and `node-pty` management. Compiles to CommonJS. Hardware acceleration disabled.
*   **Preload Script (`src/preload/index.ts`):** Exposes an `electronAPI` via `contextBridge` for IPC (Ping, PTY, Dialog, Menu Theme/Open Folder actions). Compiles to CommonJS.
*   **Renderer Process (`src/renderer`):** Uses React, TypeScript, and Vite.
    *   **Layout:** Uses `Allotment` for a resizable vertical split between the Editor and Terminal panels, inside a main content area next to a fixed `Sidebar`.
    *   **Theming:**
        *   Uses React Context (`ThemeContext`) to manage the current theme name (`light`, `dark`, `win95`, `pipboy`, `mirc`).
        *   Applies theme classes (`.theme-*`) to the root and body elements.
        *   `index.css` defines extensive CSS variables and specific style overrides for each theme.
        *   Includes a custom React dropdown component (`CustomSelect.tsx`) for theme switching in the `Sidebar`.
        *   Top application menu (`View > Theme`) reflects and can set the current theme.
    *   **Editor Panel:** Renders a functional Monaco Editor instance using `react-monaco-editor`. Basic custom Monaco themes are defined and applied based on the selected app theme (e.g., `pipboy-monaco-theme`).
    *   **Terminal Panel:** Renders a functional Xterm.js terminal using manual `Terminal` instantiation and `FitAddon`. The terminal's colors are updated based on the selected app theme. IPC bridge (`pty-create`, `pty-input`, `pty-resize`, `pty-data`, `pty-exit`) is functional. Resizing via `FitAddon` and IPC is handled.
    *   **Sidebar:** Contains a placeholder for the file tree and the custom theme switcher dropdown.

**Key Dependencies Installed:** `electron`, `react`, `typescript`, `vite`, `monaco-editor`, `react-monaco-editor`, `xterm`, `xterm-addon-fit`, `node-pty`, `allotment`, `electron-squirrel-startup`.

**V1 Goals Recap (Original + New):**
*   Functional Monaco Editor (Done - basic)
*   Integrated Terminal (xterm+node-pty) (Done - basic)
*   File Tree/Management (Not started)
*   Theming (Foundation done: CSS Vars, aesthetic themes, VS Code compatible base needed)
*   Font Size Control (To be implemented)
*   Movable/Resizable Panels (Partially done - vertical split)

**Next Steps to Implement:**

1.  **File Management (Core Functionality):**
    *   **Sidebar UI:** Replace placeholder with a file/folder listing component.
    *   **Open Folder:** Wire up the "File > Open Folder..." menu item (and/or add a button) to trigger `dialog:openDirectory` IPC, store the selected path in the renderer state/context.
    *   **Read Directory:** Implement IPC handler (`fs:read-directory`) in main using Node `fs` to read contents of the selected path. Send file/folder list back.
    *   **Display Tree:** Populate Sidebar component with the list, make it expandable/collapsible.
    *   **Read File:** IPC handler (`fs:read-file`) in main to read file content.
    *   **Load in Editor:** On file click, trigger `fs:read-file` IPC, update Monaco Editor value and language mode.
    *   **Save File:** IPC handler (`fs:save-file`) in main. Add save mechanism (Ctrl+S, menu) in renderer to send content/path.
    *   **(Optional)** Tabs for multiple open files.

2.  **Theming System (Phase 2 - VS Code Integration):**
    *   IPC handlers for opening/reading VS Code theme `.json` files.
    *   Main process parser to extract colors (`workbench.colorCustomizations`, `tokenColors`).
    *   Map VS Code keys to our CSS variables & Monaco theme keys.
    *   Dynamically update CSS variables and apply `monaco.editor.defineTheme`.

3.  **Theming System (Phase 3 - Refinements):**
    *   Refine aesthetic theme definitions (CSS and Monaco) for better accuracy/completeness.
    *   Handle font loading robustly.

4.  **Font Size Control:**
    *   Re-implement a robust font size control mechanism (e.g., using context, updating CSS variables, ensuring editor/terminal resize correctly).

5.  **Layout Enhancements:**
    *   Consider adding horizontal splitting (e.g., Sidebar vs Main Content Area) using `Allotment`.
    *   Explore more complex layouts if needed (e.g., multiple editor groups like VS Code, potentially using React-Mosaic).

6.  **Terminal Refinements:**
    *   Improve visual handling of the `pty-exit` event.
    *   Add a "clear terminal" command/button.

7.  **Editor Enhancements:**
    *   Configure more Monaco options (minimap, word wrap, etc.).
    *   Indicate unsaved changes.

**Question:** Which of these next steps should we focus on now? (File Management is strongly recommended as the next core feature).
